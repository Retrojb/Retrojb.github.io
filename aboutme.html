                   ABOUT ME:Welcome to Baltes Design and Development. My name is John Baltes
                   I am currently a Junior Web Developer and Certified Cartographer. A little 
                   bit about myself, I gained my Associates degree in Georgraphy and a certificate
                   in GIS from Sinclair Community College in Dayton, Oh in 2016. I moved to 
                   Columbus to continue my education at Ohio State University, where I have studied
                   GIS, Geography and Art. I desided to expand my knowledge and joined We Can {Code} IT

                   has started my initative to combine my skills to help.
